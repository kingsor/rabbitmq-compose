# rabbitmq-compose

Docker compose file for working with rabbit mq

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy RabbitMQ using Docker Compose, you will need to have a few things in place. Here are the prerequisites:

- Docker - You will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system. If you don't have Docker installed already, you can download it from the official Docker website. Be sure to download the version that is appropriate for your operating system.
- Docker Compose - You will also need to have Docker Compose installed on your system. Docker Compose comes pre-installed with Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS, but if you are using Linux or if you need to install it separately, you can follow the instructions on the [Docker Compose documentation page for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).
